# This came courtesy of some helpful research regarding Chinese Remainder Theorem,
# which is number theory I am 100% not familiar with.

# The modular multiplicative inverse of the product of all primes divided by the current prime (prodDivX),
# with respect to the current prime (x).

# Chinese remainder theorem states that there is some number n where:
#    n = ( âˆ‘ (remainder[i] * prodDivX(i) * mod_inverse(prodDivX(i), i) ) % totalProd
# The greek sigma indicates a summation of the above formula for all numbers in the series, denoted by i.
