# When encountering problems that deal with unbounded increasing numbers and you need to determine the cycles of them,
# you can simply keep moduloing the growing numbers by the least common multiple (LCM) of all of the cycle intervals.
# This ensures that your numbers do not get unwieldy while still allowing you to test them for the various
# cycles/divisors.

# For 1D segment overlaps:
def overlap_1d(min1, max1, min2, max2):
    return max(0, min(max1, max2) - max(min1, min2)) + \
           1 if max1 <= min2 or min1 <= max2 else 0

# This came courtesy of some helpful research regarding Chinese Remainder Theorem,
# which is number theory I am 100% not familiar with.

# The modular multiplicative inverse of the product of all primes divided by the current prime (prodDivX),
# with respect to the current prime (x).
def mod_inverse(prodDivX, x):
    return pow(prodDivX, x-2, x)

# Chinese remainder theorem states that there is some number n where:
#    n = ( âˆ‘ (remainder[i] * prodDivX(i) * mod_inverse(prodDivX(i), i) ) % totalProd
# The greek sigma indicates a summation of the above formula for all numbers in the series, denoted by i.
# I saw a problem that needed this in Day13 of 2020: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13
